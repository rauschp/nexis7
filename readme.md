# Nexis7 Chain

Respectfully, this project is strictly experimental. It's by no means ready for actual use, but really just used as a way for me to learn more about blockchain technology. What's a better way to learn than to build your own? Also this isn't the 7th iteration of anything.. I just like the number 7 :)

Goals for this project:
- Distributed network support via GRPC for P2P communication
- More of an authoritative consensus algorithm
- Planned simple NFT contract support
- Planned simple currency contract support
